## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Category not changing
**Solution**: Rating must cross threshold (200 or 500). Check current rating in localStorage.

### Issue: Same questions every time
**Solution**: Questions are randomized. With only 9 questions, you may see repeats. Add more questions to `sampleData.ts`.

### Issue: Rating not updating
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Verify localStorage is enabled.

### Issue: Time not tracking
**Solution**: Time is captured when you select an answer. If you don't answer, time shows as 0.

## 📈 Next Steps

### 1. Add More Questions
Edit `src/data/sampleData.ts`:
```typescript
{
  id: 10,
  question: "Your question here?",
  options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "Explanation here",
  subject: "Algorithms",
  difficulty: "Medium",
  topic: "Dynamic Programming"
}
```

### 2. Add More Subjects
Edit `src/components/quiz/QuizStart.tsx`:
```typescript
const subjects = [
  { id: 'algorithms', name: 'Algorithms' },
  { id: 'your-subject', name: 'Your Subject' },
  // Add more...
];
```

### 3. Customize Thresholds
Edit `src/lib/adaptive.ts`:
```typescript
export const categoryFromRating = (rating: number): Category => {
  if (rating >= 600) return 'Best';  // Change threshold
  if (rating >= 250) return 'Medium'; // Change threshold
  return 'Low';
};
```

### 4. Add Visual Graphs
Use Recharts (already installed):
```typescript
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis } from 'recharts';
// Add to QuizResults.tsx
```
